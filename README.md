# Vehicle Management System

## Overview
The **Vehicle Management System** is a web-based application developed using **Spring MVC**. It demonstrates the core concepts of Spring MVC by implementing a complete CRUD operation workflow. The project integrates both front-end and back-end components, with JSP pages serving as the front-end view layer. Designed for managing vehicle information efficiently, this system leverages HTTP methods for seamless interaction between the client and server.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on vehicle data.
- **Front-End Integration**: Uses JSP pages for dynamic content rendering.
- **Back-End Development**: Built on the Spring MVC architecture, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
- **HTTP Methods**: Employs standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for API interaction.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures proper validation of vehicle data before processing.
- **Error Handling**: Provides structured error handling for smooth user experience.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Adopts the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for clear distinction between data, logic, and presentation layers.

## Technologies Used
- **Framework**: Spring MVC
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **View Layer**: JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Database**: MySQL
- **IDE**: Eclipse
- **Server**: Apache Tomcat
